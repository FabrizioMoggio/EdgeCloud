    Edge Cloud API for Life Cycle Management and discovery of an application.
    # Introduction
    APIs defined in this version of the specification can be categorized into the following areas:
    * __Application__ - The Application Provider submit application metadata to the Operator Platform.
    * __Application Instance__ -  An Operator Platform instantiate an Application on an Edge Cloud Node when the Application Provider resquest it.
    * __Edge Cloud information__ - Retrieves all the Edge nodes available according to some defined parameters.
    # Relevant terms and definitions
    This section provides definitions of terminologies commonly referred to throughout the API descriptions.
 
    * __Application Provider__ - The provider of the application that accesses an OP to deploy its application on the Edge Cloud. An Application Provider may be part of a larger organisation, like an enterprise, enterprise customer of an OP, or be an independent entity.
    * __Application__ - Contains the information about the application to be instantiated. Descriptor, binary image, charts or any other package assosiated with the application. The Application Provider request contains mandatory criteria (e.g. required CPU, memory,
      storage, bandwidth) defined in an Application. 
    * __OP__ - Operator Platform. An Operator Platform (facilitates access to the Edge Cloud and other capabilities of an Operator or federation of Operators and Partners. Defined by [GSMA in OPG.02](https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OPG.02-v5.0-Operator-Platform-Requirements-and-Architecture.pdf)
    * __Region__ - Human readable name of the geografical zone of the Edge Cloud. Defined by the OP.
    * __Edge Cloud__ - Cloud-like capabilities located at the network edge including, from the Application Provider's perspective, access to elastically allocated compute, data storage and network resources.
    # API Functionality
    __Application Management__
    * __submitApp__ - Submits an application details to an OP. Based on the details provided,  OP shall do bookkeeping, resource validation and other pre-deployment operations. 
    * __deleteApp__ - Removes an application from an OP, if there is a running instance of the given application, the request cannot be done.
    * __getApp__ - Retrieves the information of a given application.
 
    __Application Instance Management__
    * __appInstantiation__  Request the OP to instatiate an instance of an application in a given Edge Cloud Node, if this parameter is not set, the OP will instantiate the applications in all the Edge Cloud Nodes available.
    * __getAppInstance__  Retrieves the list with information of the instances related to a given application.
    * __deleteAppInstance__ - Removes a given application instance from an Edge Cloud Node.

    __Edge Cloud information__
    *  __getEdgeCloudNodes__ List of the operatorâ€™s Edge Cloud Nodes and their status, ordering the results by location and filtering by status (active/inactive/unknown)
